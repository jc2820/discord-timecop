# discord-timecop

A simple Discord bot that listens in chats for instances of a friend saying they'll be "just 5 mins" (and other versions of this) and gives a stern alert when that time is up.

Discord's dev [docs](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) have a good rundown of how to install bots on your server.

Unless you want it to only run on demand with localhost you'll have to deploy it somewhere like Heroku.
